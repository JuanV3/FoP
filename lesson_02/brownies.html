    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 eggs 3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and Grease an 8
      inch square pan. In a large bowl, blend melted butter, sugar and vanilla.
      Beat in eggs one at a time. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking powder and
      salt. Gradually blend into the egg mixture. Spread the batter into the
      prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until
      brownies begin to pull away from the sides of the pan. Let brownies cool,
      then cut into squares. Enjoy! Tip Aluminum foil can be used to keep food
      moist, cook it evenly, and make clean-up easier.
